### PoseRunner

PoseRunner is a browser-based endless runner game built with Three.js. Help Aj "run" through the fellowship experience in outer space avoiding as many obstacles on your way.
For a better experience, we have added a twist- posenet, which uses the webcam to get image feed and analyze the hand gestures. This gives a player the ability to move the character with their gestures.

### Features
- Player can run endlessly as long as they have their lives secured. They will have a total of 3 lives through the game.
- MLH fellowship themed

- Calibration screen for calibrating hand gestures.
- Save player's score and high score.
