PoseRunner is a browser-based endless runner game built with Three.js.
#### Where there is Will, there is a way!
### "Run" through the MLH Fellowship in outer space, with your poses!
(also, please avoid as many obstacles as you can, _if_ you can :p)

## It's not just a regular runner game, we have added a special twist for you - PoseNet! üò≤

#### Use your webcam to control your character!
We analyze your arm gestures.

- Doing this will trigger "Right" ‚û°Ô∏è.
